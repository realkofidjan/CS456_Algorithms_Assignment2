# StringMatch.py

This program implements the brute-force string matching algorithm for Question 5.


## Usage
Running the Program

The program can be executed from the command line using one of the following commands:

1. To run interactively:

```python
python3 StringMatch.py interactive

```

2. To run an input file:

```python
python3 StringMatch.py file

```


NB. When running these commands, make sure your terminal path is the same as the path for the 'StringMatch.py' file.



## Input
- If you choose to run the program interactively, you will be prompted to enter some text, followed by a pattern to search for. The program will then display the index of the first occurrence of the pattern in the text.
- If you choose to run the program using a file input, you should create a file named 'input.txt'. The first line of the file should indicate the number of test cases. Following that, each pair of lines represents the text to search and the pattern to search for, respectively. The program will output the results to a file named 'output.txt'.
